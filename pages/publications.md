#### <u>Moving beyond P values: data analysis with estimation graphics.</u>
*For at least 77 years, the limitations of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) have been discussed, without agreement on a suitable alternative. Estimation methods that estimate effect sizes and their uncertainty have great potential to shift the current data-analysis culture away from dichotomous thinking and toward quantitative reasoning. Although NHST limits the analyst to the ill-conceived question of “Does it?”, estimation instead draws the analyst’s attention to the question of “How much?”—the very topic that defines quantitative research. Here we describe the estimation graphic, a plot that displays an experimental dataset’s complete statistical information. We also introduce software that makes high-quality estimation graphics available to all.*
